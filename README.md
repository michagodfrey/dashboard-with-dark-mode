## My process

### Built with

This one was built with the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp) - The straight-forward example of how to use a dark mode toggle using JavaScript DOM manipulation was all I needed to figure out how to implement a much more complicated example in this project.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_switch ) - I basically took the toggle button off the shelf from this invaluable resource. Only minor edits made to match the design.
- [The great Kevin Powell's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - video on pseudo classes really helped things click for me and I was able to implement a pseudo class for the background.
- [HTML-CSS-JS](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/gradient/) - Is a site I frequently use for no fuss color gradient code and more.
- [HTML Colors](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - Came in handy converting supplied HSL colors to HEX format.
- [John Smilga's color generator](https://react-projects-9-color-generator.netlify.app/) - Is a handy tool for finding hex values of colors a certain percentage lighter or darker of prescribed colors. This is useful for hover effects that don't seem to be specified in the style guide.
