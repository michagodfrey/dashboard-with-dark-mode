## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

With a few imperfections compared to the design, I think I have largely achieved this. Although this site has light mode as the default whereas the design appears to be have dark mode as default.

This project was a a refresher after a short non-voluntary break from practising coding. I was glad I managed to build this in the time I estimated it would take. This is a mock up, and the stats are hard coded.

## My process

### Built with

This one was built with the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### What I learned

This was a reminder of how hard naming things can be! I tried to follow a naming convention that had some consistency but as the dark mode was implemented I added more classes to switch colors with JavaScript.

If I had more time to spend on this, I'm sure I could figure out a neater class naming system and more concise JavaScript. However, I did manage this under the time I estimated it would take.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp) - The straight-forward example of how to use a dark mode toggle using JavaScript DOM manipulation was all I needed to figure out how to implement a much more complicated example in this project.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_switch ) - I basically took the toggle button off the shelf from this invaluable resource. Only minor edits made to match the design.
- [HTML-CSS-JS](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/gradient/) - Is a site I frequently use for no fuss color gradient code and more.
- [HTML Colors](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - Came in handy converting supplied HSL colors to HEX format.
- [John Smilga's color generator](https://react-projects-9-color-generator.netlify.app/) - Is a handy tool for finding hex values of colors a certain percentage lighter or darker of prescribed colors. This is useful for hover effects that don't seem to be specified in the style guide.
